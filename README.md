# Pokedex Creator

Previously attatched to my pythemon repo, this project has now been split off since it can easily serve as its own project. The program is very straightfoward--running the file will make several hundreds of API requests via the PokePy PokeAPI-wrapper. This data is consolidated in a python-dict object that is then serialized into a JSON file named "pokedex.json" in the same directory as the program.

# TO-DO:
    1) Berry and Item JSON objects
    2) Descriptions
    3) How will we handle evolution chains? Evolution levels? Evolution items and methods?
    4) Characteristics!!! IVs!!!!
    5) Max level and Max experience
    6) Natures?
    7) Encounters? location_area_encounters
    8) Use PokeAPI sprites?
    9) Pokemon move learned at levels?
    10) Pokemon  with different forms?
    11) All of GEN II included?
