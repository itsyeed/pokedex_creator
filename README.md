# Pokedex Creator

Previously attatched to my pythemon repo, this project has now been split off since it can easily serve as its own project. The program is very straightfoward--running the file will make several hundreds of API requests via the PokePy PokeAPI-wrapper. This data is consolidated in a python-dict object that is then serialized into a JSON file named "pokedex.json" in the same directory as the program.

# TO-DO:
  1) Expand to include Ability JSON object
  2) Expand to include Evolution Chain JSON object
